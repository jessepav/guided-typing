# HELEN AND THE PET STORE

One day Helen went to the pet store.

There were people there buying pets -- mostly normal animals like
dogs and cats and birds. But there were two animals in the back
that no-one wanted.

------

The shopkeeper said, "If those pets aren't adopted, I'm going to
have to send them to the orphanage."

Helen looked at those animals, and saw they were two cuties with
round heads. They were Moo Moos! One was white and red, and the
other was blue.

------

Helen said, "I'll adopt these two!" The shopkeeper opened their
cages and they came out and cuddled her. Helen took them home and
they all loved each other very much.


## MIKEY AND THE SLIME

Mikey was walking to the candy store one day. He was almost there
when he heard a strange sound. It sounded like "Shloop, shloop".
He turned and looked behind him, and gasped.

It was a blob of gooey slime!

---

The slime was not a normal slime: it was a slime with two eyes and a
big smile. It looked friendly.
