# A Chapter Title

(This is a sample story: edit it as you wish,
 and then click the Save button below.)

A paragraph of text. Paragraphs are separated
from one another by a blank line.

---

Three or more dashes, like above, will separate
sections from one another. Thus, this paragraph
is in its own clickable section.

## Second Chapter Title

Lines that begin with '#' or '##' start a chapter.
If the line starts with '#' (like the first chapter)
the chapter will be initially open, and if '##'
(like the second chapter) the chapter will be collapsed.

And that's pretty much it!
