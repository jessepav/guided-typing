## Story Formatting Help

A "story" (that is, the entire document) is divided into chapters, and
the chapters into sections. When the user clicks a section, a typing
area and keyboard will popup and guide her through the typing of the
section.

A line that starts with `#` or `##` is a chapter title. If the line
starts with `#` the chapter will be initially open, and if `##` the
chapter will be collapsed (click it to open).

Each section is made up of one or more paragraphs. A paragraph is a
block of text divided from other paragraphs by a blank line.

Use three or more dashes `-` on a line by themselves to demarcate each
section.  Sections should be kept relatively short, because the section
text, typing text area, and displayed keyboard should all fit on the
screen at once.

### Example Story

<div class="example-story">

\# HELEN AND THE PET STORE

One day Helen went to the pet store.

There were people there buying pets -- mostly normal animals like
dogs and cats and birds. But there were two animals in the back
that no-one wanted.

\------

The shopkeeper said, "If those pets aren't adopted, I'm going to
have to send them to the orphanage."

Helen looked at those animals, and saw they were two cuties with
round heads. They were Moo Moos! One was white and red, and the
other was blue.

\------

Helen said, "I'll adopt these two!" The shopkeeper opened their
cages and they came out and cuddled her. Helen took them home and
they all loved each other very much.


\## MIKEY AND THE POOP

Mikey was walking to the candy store one day. He was almost there
when he heard a strange sound. It sounded like "Shloop, shloop".
He turned and looked behind him, and gasped.

It was a poop!

\---

The poop was not a normal poop: it was a poop with two eyes and a
big smile.
